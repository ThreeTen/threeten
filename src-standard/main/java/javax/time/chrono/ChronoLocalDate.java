/**
 * A date expressed in terms of a standard year-month-day calendar system.
 * <p>
 * This class is used by applications seeking to handle dates in non-ISO calendar systems.
 * For example, the Japanese, Minguo, Thai Buddhist and others.
 * <a href="package-summary.html">Sample code</a> can be found in the package documentation.
 * <p>
 * {@code ChronoLocalDate} is built on the generic concepts of year, month and day.
 * The calendar system, represented by a {@link Chronology}, expresses the relationship between
 * the fields and this class allows the resulting date to be manipulated.
 * <p>
 * Note that not all calendar systems are suitable for use with this class.
 * For example, the Mayan calendar uses a system that bears no relation to years, months and days.
 * <p>
 * The API design encourages the use of {@code LocalDate} for the majority of the application.
 * This includes code to read and write from a persistent data store, such as a database,
 * and to send dates and times across a network. The {@code ChronoLocalDate} instance is then used
 * at the user interface level to deal with localized input/output.
 *
 * <h4>Adding Calendars</h4>
 * <p> The set of calendars is extensible by defining a subclass of {@link javax.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate}
 * to represent a date instance and an implementation of {@link javax.time.chrono.Chronology}
 * to be the factory for the ChronoLocalDate subclass.
 * </p>
 * <p> To permit the discovery of the additional calendar types the implementation of 
 * {@link javax.time.chrono.Chronology} must be registered as a Service implementing
 * the {@link javax.time.chrono.Chronology} interface in the {@code META-INF/Services}
 * file as per the specification of {@link java.util.ServiceLoader}.
 * The subclass must function according to the Chronology interface and must provide its
 * {@link Chronology#getId calendar name} and
 * {@link Chronology#getCalendarType() calendar type}. </p>
 *
 * <h4>Implementation notes</h4>
 * This abstract class must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
 * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 * Subclasses should be Serializable wherever possible.
 * 
 * @param <C> the Chronology of this date
