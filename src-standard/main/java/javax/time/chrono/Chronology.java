/**
 * A standard year-month-day calendar system.
 * <p>
 * This class is used by applications seeking to handle dates in non-ISO calendar systems.
 * For example, the Gregorian, Japanese, Minguo, Thai Buddhist and others.
 * It is built on the generic concepts of year, month and day - subclasses define the
 * meaning of those concepts in the calendar system that they represent.
 * <p>
 * In practical terms, the {@code Chrono} instance also acts as a factory.
 * The {@link #ofName(String)} method allows an instance to be looked up by name.
 * Note that the result will be an instance configured using the default values for that calendar.
 * <p>
 * The {@code Chrono} class provides a set of methods to create {@code ChronoDate} instances.
 * The date classes are used to manipulate specific dates.
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link #now() now()}
 * <li> {@link #now(Clock) now(clock)}
 * <li> {@link #date(int, int, int) date(year, month, day)}
 * <li> {@link #date(javax.time.chrono.Era, int, int, int) date(era, year, month, day)}
 * <li> {@link #date(javax.time.calendrical.DateTime) date(Calendrical)}
 * <li> {@link #dateFromEpochDay(long) dateFromEpochDay(epochDay)}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h4 id="addcalendars">Adding New Calendars</h4>
 * <p>
 * A new calendar system may be defined and registered with this factory.
 * Implementors must provide a subclass of this class and the matching {@code ChronoDate}.
 * The {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} mechanism is then used to register the calendar.
 * 
 * <h4>Implementation notes</h4>
 * This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
 * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 * Subclasses should be Serializable wherever possible.
