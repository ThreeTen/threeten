/**
 * A date expressed in terms of a standard year-month-day calendar system.
 * <p>
 * This class is used by applications seeking to handle dates in non-ISO calendar systems.
 * For example, the Japanese, Minguo, Thai Buddhist and others.
 * <p>
 * {@code ChronoDate} is built on the generic concepts of year, month and day.
 * The calendar system, represented by a {@link Chronology}, expresses the relationship between
 * the fields and this class allows the resulting date to be manipulated.
 * <p>
 * Note that not all calendar systems are suitable for use with this class.
 * For example, the Mayan calendar uses a system that bears no relation to years, months and days.
 * <p>
 * The API design encourages the use of {@code LocalDate} for the majority of the application.
 * This includes code to read and write from a persistent data store, such as a database,
 * and to send dates and times across a network. The {@code ChronoDate} instance is then used
 * at the user interface level to deal with localized input/output.
 * 
 * <h4>Implementation notes</h4>
 * This abstract class must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
 * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 * Subclasses should be Serializable wherever possible.
