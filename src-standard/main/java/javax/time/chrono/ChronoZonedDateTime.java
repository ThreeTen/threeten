/**
 * A date-time with a time-zone in the calendar neutral API.
 * <p>
 * {@code ZoneChronoDateTime} is an immutable representation of a date-time with a time-zone.
 * This class stores all date and time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds,
 * as well as a time-zone and zone offset. 
 * <p>
 * The purpose of storing the time-zone is to distinguish the ambiguous case where
 * the local time-line overlaps, typically as a result of the end of daylight time.
 * Information about the local-time can be obtained using methods on the time-zone.
 * <p>
 * This class provides control over what happens at these cutover points
 * (typically a gap in spring and an overlap in autumn). The {@link ZoneResolver}
 * interface and implementations in {@link ZoneResolvers} provide strategies for
 * handling these cases. The methods {@link #withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap()} and
 * {@link #withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()} provide further control for overlaps.
 * 
 * <h4>Implementation notes</h4>
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
 *
 * @param <C> the Chronology of this date
