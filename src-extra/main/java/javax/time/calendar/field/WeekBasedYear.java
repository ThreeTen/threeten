/**
 * A representation of a week-based-year in the ISO-8601 calendar system.
 * <p>
 * WeekBasedYear is an immutable time field that can only store a week-based-year.
 * It is a type-safe way of representing a week-based-year in an application.
 * <p>
 * A week-based-year is the year that is applicable when using the
 * ISO-8601 week based date calculation. In this system, the week-based-year
 * may begin up to three days early or three days late.
 * <p>
 * For example, 2007-01-01 is Monday, thus the week-based-year of 2007
 * also begins on 2007-01-01. In 2008, the first day of the year is Tuesday,
 * with the Monday being in year 2007. However, the week-based-year for both
 * Monday and Tuesday is 2008.
 * <pre>
 *   Date     DayOfWeek  Week-based year
 * 2007-12-30  Sunday     2007-W52
 * 2007-12-31  Monday     2008-W01
 * 2007-01-01  Tuesday    2008-W01
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The ISO-8601 rules state that the first week of the year is the one that
 * contains the first Thursday of the year.
 * <p>
 * Static factory methods allow you to construct instances.
 * The week-based-year may be queried using getValue().
 * <p>
 * WeekBasedYear is immutable and thread-safe.
