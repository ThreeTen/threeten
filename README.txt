ThreeTen
========
ThreeTen provides a modern date and time library for Java.
It is the reference implementation for JSR-310.

See the home page for more details and downloads:
Home page and downloads are at Sourceforge.
http://threeten.sourceforge.net/

The source code is held primarily at GitHub:
https://github.com/ThreeTen/threeten

Geting started
--------------
The main build process uses Apache Ant - http://ant.apache.org
From the command line the following options will get you started:
  ant                 # downloads libraries and compiles code to a jar file
  ant examples        # runs a supplied java program to print some examples
  ant javadoc         # creates the javadoc
  ant test            # runs the main test suite (excluding OpenJDK classes)
  ant tck             # runs the tck acceptance test. NB: you must use the -Dtck.implementation parameter in order to specify the jar under test
  ant coverage        # calculates test coverage (excluding OpenJDK classes)
Oracle JDK 1.6 (or OpenJDK) is required to build the codebase.


Basic user guide
----------------
ThreeTen divides time into two categories - continuous and human.

Continuous time is based around a single incrementing number from a single epoch.
ThreeTen counts in nanoseconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z
Continuous time is represented as follows:
 - Instant - a point on the time-line to nanosecond precision
 - Duration - an amount of time measured in nanoseconds

Human time is based around fields, such as year, month, day and hour.
ThreeTen supports precision of nanoseconds.
The year range roughly equal to the range of a 32-bit int.
Human time is represented via a group of classes:
 - LocalDate - a date, without time of day, offset or zone
 - LocalTime - the time of day, without date, offset or zone
 - LocalDateTime - the date and time, without offset or zone
 - OffsetDate - a date with an offset such as +02:00, without time of day or zone
 - OffsetTime - the time of day with an offset such as +02:00, without date or zone
 - OffsetDateTime - the date and time with an offset such as +02:00, without a zone
 - ZonedDateTime - the date and time with a time zone and offset
 - YearMonth - a year and month
 - MonthDay - month and day
 - Year/MonthOfDay/DayOfWeek/... - classes for the important fields
 - DateTimeFields - stores a map of field-value pairs which may be invalid
 - Calendrical - access to the low-level API
 - Period - a descriptive amount of time, such as "2 months and 3 days"

Support classes include:
 - Clock - wraps the current date and time
 - ZoneOffset - the offset from UTC, such as -05:00
 - ZoneId - the time zone, such as Europe/London
 - Numerous small interfaces - these link the main classes together

Additional packages provide for:
 - formatting and parsing
 - alternate calendar systems
 - single field periods
 - integration with existing Java classes


Status
------
The ThreeTen project is used to drive the reference implementation of JSR-310.
The API is currently considered usable and accurate, yet incomplete and subject to change.
If you use this API you must be able to handle incompatible changes in later versions.

Special efforts with the boot classpath are necessary to test and use
the integration with the existing Java classes.

Test coverage is high and all current tests pass.
