/**
 * Provides access to a versioned set of time-zone rules from a single group.
 * <p>
 * Multiple providers of time-zone rules may be registered.
 * Each provider will supply one to many zone IDs.
 * No two providers may overlap in the set of zone IDs that they provide.
 * <p>
 * The values returned by the provider must never change over time.
 * A new provider must be returned to return new regions or versions.
 * <p>
 * Many systems would like to receive new time-zone rules dynamically.
 * This must be implemented separately from this interface, typically using a listener.
 * Whenever the listener detects new rules it should call
 * {@link ZoneRulesGroup#registerProvider(ZoneRulesDataProvider)} using a standard
 * immutable provider implementation.
 * <p>
 * This interface is a service provider that can be called by multiple threads.
 * Implementations must be immutable and thread-safe.
