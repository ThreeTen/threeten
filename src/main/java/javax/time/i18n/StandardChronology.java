/**
 * A standard calendar system formed of eras, years, months and days.
 * <p>
 * Most calendar systems are formed of common elements - eras, years, months and days.
 * This class provides a common way to access this in association with {@link ChronologyDate}.
 * See the individual methods for descriptions of the standard concepts.
 * <p>
 * Note that not all calendar systems fit this "standard" definition.
 * For example, the Mayan calendar has a completely different way of counting.
 * <p>
 * This is an abstract class and must be implemented with care to
 * ensure other classes in the framework operate correctly.
 * All instantiable subclasses must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 * Wherever possible subclasses should be singletons with no public constructor.
 * It is recommended that subclasses implement {@code Serializable}.
