/**
 * A date based on standard chronology rules.
 * <p>
 * The majority of the Time Framework for Java is based on the ISO-8601 chronology which
 * is the <i>de facto</i> world calendar.
 * This class allows dates in other calendar systems to be stored.
 * <p>
 * Not all calendar systems are suitable for use with this class.
 * For example, the Mayan calendar uses a system that bears no relation to years, months and days.
 * A calendar system may be used if the {@link Chronology} supports the standard set of rules
 * based on era, year, month and day-of-month.
 * <p>
 * Unlike {@link LocalDate}, this class uses {@code int} values for all fields.
 * This is a pragmatic choice to avoid coding one class for each calendar system.
 * Application writers working primarily with another calendar system may choose to write
 * a dedicated class, in the same way as {@code LocalDate} is dedicated to ISO-8601.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class may be created from other date objects that implement {@code Calendrical}.
 * Notably this includes {@code LocalDate} and all other date classes from other calendar systems.
 * <p>
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
