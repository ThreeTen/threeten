 * The Coptic calendar system.
 * <p>
 * This {@link StandardChronology standard} chronology defines the rules of the Coptic calendar system.
 * The Coptic calendar has twelve months of 30 days followed by an additional
 * period of 5 or 6 days, modeled as the thirteenth month in this implementation.
 * <p>
 * Years are measured in the 'Era of the Martyrs' - AM.
 * 0001-01-01 (Coptic) equals 0284-08-29 (ISO).
 * The supported range is from 1 to 99999999 (inclusive) in both eras.
