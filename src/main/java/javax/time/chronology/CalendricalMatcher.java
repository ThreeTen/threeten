/**
 * Strategy for matching against a calendrical.
 * <p>
 * Matchers can be used to query the calendrical in unusual ways.
 * Examples might be a matcher that checks if the date is a weekend or holiday,
 * or Friday the Thirteenth.
 * <p>
 * A matcher is not normally used directly. Instead it should normally be used as follows:
 * <pre>
 *   if (date.matches(matcher)) ...
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes in
 * the framework operate correctly.
 * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.

     * Checks if the input calendrical matches the rules of the implementation.
     * <p>
     * This is a strategy pattern that allows a range of matches to be made
     * against a calendrical. A typical implementation will query the calendrical
     * to extract one of more values, and compare or check them in some way.
     * <p>
     * For example, an implementation to check if the calendrical represents a
     * Saturday or Sunday:
     * <pre>
     *  public boolean matchesCalendrical(Calendrical calendrical) {
     *    DayOfWeek dow = calendrical.get(ISODateTimeRule.DAY_OF_WEEK);
     *    return dow != null && (dow == DayOfWeek.SATURDAY || dow == DayOfWeek.SUNDAY);
     *  }
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param calendrical  the calendrical to match against, not null
     * @return true if the date matches, false otherwise
