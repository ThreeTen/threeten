/**
 * A rule defining how a single well-defined calendrical element operates.
 * <p>
 * Calendrical rules may define fields like day-of-month, combinations like date-time,
 * or other related types like time-zone.
 * <p>
 * Each rule uses an underlying type to represent the data.
 * This is captured in the generic type of the rule.
 * The underlying type is reified and made available via {@link #getType()}.
 * It is expected, but not enforced, that the underlying type is {@link Comparable}.
 * <p>
 * This is an abstract class and must be implemented with care to
 * ensure other classes in the framework operate correctly.
 * All instantiable subclasses must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 * Subclasses should implement {@code equals} and {@code hashCode}.
 * The subclass is also fully responsible for serialization as all fields in this class are
 * transient. The subclass must use {@code readResolve} to replace the deserialized
 * class with a valid one created via a constructor.
