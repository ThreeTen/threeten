/**
 * Strategy for resolving a {@code LocalDateTime} to an {@code OffsetDateTime}
 * using the rules of a time-zone.
 * <p>
 * A time-zone provides rules for when and by how much the offset changes for a given location.
 * These rules can result in gaps in the local time-line, such as at the spring daylight
 * savings cutover, and overlaps, such as at the autumn cutover.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this resolver handles these missing and overlapping cases by either
 * throwing an exception, selecting the appropriate offset or changing the local date-time.
 * <p>
 * This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes in
 * the framework operate correctly.
 * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
