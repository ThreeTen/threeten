/**
 * A calendar system, consisting of rules controlling the passage of human-scale time.
 * <p>
 * Calendar systems describe a set of fields that can be used to describe time
 * in a human-scale. Typical fields include year, month-of-year and day-of-month.
 * <p>
 * This abstract base class provides a common mechanism to access the standard
 * fields which are supported in the vast majority of calendar systems.
 * Subclasses will provide the full set of fields for that calendar system.
 * <p>
 * The default chronology is {@link ISOChronology ISO-8601} which is the
 * <i>de facto</i> world calendar today.
 * <p>
 * This is an abstract class and must be implemented with care to
 * ensure other classes in the framework operate correctly.
 * All instantiable subclasses must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 * Wherever possible subclasses should be singletons with no public constructor.
 * It is recommended that subclasses implement {@code Serializable}
