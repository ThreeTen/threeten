/**
 * Provides access to a period of time, such as '2 Years and 5 Months'.
 * <p>
 * PeriodProvider is a simple interface that provides uniform access to
 * any object that can provide access to a period.
 * <p>
 * The implementation of {@code PeriodProvider} may be mutable.
 * The result of {@link #toPeriodFields()}, however, is immutable.
 * <p>
 * When implementing an API that accepts a {@code PeriodProvider} as a parameter,
 * it is important to convert the input to a {@code PeriodFields} once and once only.
 * It is recommended that this is done at the top of the method before other processing.
 * This is necessary to handle the case where the implementation of the provider is
 * mutable and changes in value between two calls to {@code toPeriodFields()}.
 * <p>
 * The recommended way to convert a DateProvider to a LocalDate is using
 * {@link PeriodFields#of(PeriodProvider)} as this method provides additional null checking.
 * <p>
 * This interface makes no guarantees about the thread-safety or immutability of implementations.

     * The amount stored for a unit in the result may be zero.
     * If this object is already a {@code PeriodFields} then it is simply returned.
