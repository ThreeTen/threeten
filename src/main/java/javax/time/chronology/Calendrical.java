/**
 * Provides access in a uniform way to calendrical values.
 * <p>
 * All classes that can provide calendrical information should implement this interface.
 * The single method allows a calendrical to be queried to find the value of a rule.
 * A calendrical might be a single field, such as month-of-year or hour-of-day, or a
 * whole object, such as {@code LocalDate} or {@code ZoneOffset}.
 * <p>
 * This interface makes no guarantees about the thread-safety or immutability of implementations.

     * Gets the value of the specified calendrical rule.
     * <p>
     * This method queries the value of the specified rule.
     * If the rule is not supported then {@code null} will be returned.
     * <p>
     * Where this method returns numeric values, Integer is the preferred type.
     * The values should be within the range of the field wherever possible.
     * For example, minute-of-hour should be from 0 to 59 inclusive.
     * The calling code must validate the value however and not trust it to be valid.
     * <p>
     * The standard implementation of this method calls one of the static {@code derive}
     * methods on {@link CalendricalEngine}.
     * <p>
     * Implementations must ensure that calls to this method are thread-safe.
     * An immutable implementation will naturally provide this guarantee.

     * @return the value for the rule, null if no value for the rule
