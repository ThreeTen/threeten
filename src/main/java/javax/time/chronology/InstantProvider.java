/**
 * Provides access to an instant on the time-line.
 * <p>
 * {@code InstantProvider} is a simple interface that provides uniform access to any
 * object that can provide access to an {@code Instant}.
 * <p>
 * The implementation of {@code InstantProvider} may be mutable.
 * For example, {@link java.util.Date Date} is a mutable implementation of this interface.
 * The result of calling {@link #toInstant()} is always immutable.
 * <p>
 * When implementing an API that accepts an {@code InstantProvider} as a parameter, it is
 * important to convert the input to a {@code Instant} once and once only.
 * It is recommended that this is done at the top of the method before other processing.
 * This is necessary to handle the case where the implementation of the provider is
 * mutable and changes in value between two calls to {@code toInstant()}.
 * <p>
 * The recommended way to convert an {@code InstantProvider} to a {@code Instant} is using
 * {@link Instant#of(InstantProvider)} as this method provides additional null checking.
 * <p>
 * The implementation of {@code InstantProvider} may provide more
 * information than just an instant. For example,
 * {@link javax.time.calendar.ZonedDateTime ZonedDateTime}, implements this
 * interface and also provides full date, time and time-zone information.
 * <p>
 * This interface makes no overall guarantees about the thread-safety or immutability
 * of implementations. However, the method itself has a specific thread-safe guarantee.

     * Returns an instance of {@code Instant} initialized from the

     * <p>
     * This method will take the instant represented by this object and return
     * an {@link Instant}. If this object is already a {@code Instant}
     * then it is simply returned.
     * <p>
     * If this object does not support nanosecond precision, then all fields

     * nanoseconds part of the {@code Instant} will be set to zero.
     * It is recommended that this interface should only be implemented by classes
     * that provide time information to at least minute precision.

     * Implementations must ensure that calls to this method are thread-safe.
