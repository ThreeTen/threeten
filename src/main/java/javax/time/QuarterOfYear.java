/**
 * A quarter-of-year, such as 'Q2'.
 * <p>
 * {@code QuarterOfYear} is an enum representing the 4 quarters of the year -
 * Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4. These are defined as January to March, April to June,
 * July to September and October to December.
 * <p>
 * The calendrical framework requires date-time fields to have an {@code int} value.
 * The {@code int} value follows the quarter, from 1 (Q1) to 4 (Q4).
 * It is recommended that applications use the enum rather than the {@code int} value
 * to ensure code clarity.
 * <p>
 * <b>Do not use {@code ordinal()} to obtain the numeric representation of {@code QuarterOfYear}.
 * Use {@code getValue()} instead.</b>
 * <p>
 * This enum represents a common concept that is found in many calendar systems.
 * As such, this enum may be used by any calendar system that has the quarter-of-year
 * concept defined exactly equivalent to the ISO calendar system.
 * <p>
 * This is an immutable and thread-safe enum.
