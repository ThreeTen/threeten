/**
 * General access to a date and/or time object that is complete enough to be manipulated.
 * <p>
 * There are two types of date-time class modeled in the API.
 * The first, {@link DateTimeAccessor}, expresses the date-time only as a map of field to value.
 * The second, this interface, extends that to also support addition and subtraction.
 * <p>
 * For example, a class representing the combination of day-of-week and day-of-month,
 * suitable for storing "Friday the 13th", would implement only the former.
 * By contrast, a {@link LocalDate} or {@link LocalTime} implements this interface.
 * 
 * <h4>Formal definition</h4>
 * <p>
 * Formally, a class should implement this interface if it meets three criteria:
 * <ul>
 * <li>it represents a map of date-time fields to values (as per {@code DateTimeAccessor})
 * <li>the set of fields are contiguous from the largest to the smallest
 * <li>the set of fields are complete, such that no other field is needed to define the
 *  valid range of values for the fields that are represented
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Four examples make this clear:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code LocalDate} should implement this interface as it represents a set of fields
 *  that are contiguous from days to forever and require no external information to determine
 *  the validity of each date. It is therefore able to implement plus/minus correctly.
 * <li>{@code LocalTime} should implement this interface as it represents a set of fields
 *  that are contiguous from nanos to within days and require no external information to determine
 *  validity. It is able to implement plus/minus correctly, by wrapping around the day.
 * <li>The combination of month-of-year and day-of-month should not implement this interface.
 *  While the combination is contiguous, from days to months within years, the combination does
 *  not have sufficient information to define the valid range of values for day-of-month.
 *  As such, it is unable to implement plus/minus correctly.
 * <li>The combination day-of-week and day-of-month ("Friday the 13th") should not implement
 *  this interface. It does not represent a contiguous set of fields, as days to weeks overlaps
 *  days to months.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h4>Implementation notes</h4>
 * This interface places no restrictions on implementations and makes no guarantees
 * about their thread-safety.
 * All implementations must be {@link Comparable}.
