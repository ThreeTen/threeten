/**
 * Strategy for adjusting a date-time object.
 * <p>
 * This interface provides a common way to access many different adjustments.
 * Examples might be an adjuster that sets the date avoiding weekends, or one that
 * sets the date to the last day of the month.
 * <p>
 * An adjuster should not normally used directly. Instead it should be used as follows:
 * <pre>
 *   date = date.with(adjuster);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * See {@link DateTimeAdjusters} for a standard set of adjusters, including finding the
 * last day of the month.
 * 
 * <h4>Implementation notes</h4>
 * This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
 * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.

     * Implementation of the strategy to make an adjustment to the specified date-time object.
     * <p>
     * This method is not intended to be called by application code directly.
     * Applications should use the {@code with(DateTimeAdjuster)} method on the
     * date-time object to make the adjustment passing this as the argument.
     * 
     * <h4>Implementation notes</h4>
     * The implementation takes the input object and adjusts it according to an algorithm.
     * For example, it could be used to adjust a date to "next Wednesday".
     * <p>
     * Implementations must use the methods on {@code AdjustableDateTime} to make the adjustment.
     * The returned object must have the same observable type as this object.
     * The input object will be mutated if it is mutable, or a new object returned if immutable.
     * <p>
     * This interface can be used by calendar systems other than ISO.
     * Implementations may choose to document compatibility with other calendar systems, or
     * validate for it by querying the calendar system from the input object.
     *
     * @param dateTime  the date-time object to adjust, not null
     * @return an object of the same type with the adjustment made, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if unable to make the adjustment
     * @throws RuntimeException if the result exceeds the supported range
