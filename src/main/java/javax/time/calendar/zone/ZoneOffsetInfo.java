/**
 * Information about the valid offsets applicable for a local date-time.
 * <p>
 * The mapping from a local date-time to an offset is not straightforward.
 * There are three cases:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Normal. Where there is a single offset for the local date-time.</li>
 * <li>Gap. Where there is a gap in the local time-line typically caused by the
 * spring cutover to daylight savings. There are no valid offsets within the gap</li>
 * <li>Overlap. Where there is a gap in the local time-line typically caused by the
 * autumn cutover from daylight savings. There are two valid offsets during the overlap.</li>
 * </ul>
 * When using this class, it is vital to check the {@link #isTransition()}
 * method to handle the gap and overlap. Alternatively use one of the general
 * methods {@link #getEstimatedOffset()} or {@link #isValidOffset(ZoneOffset)}.
 * <p>
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
