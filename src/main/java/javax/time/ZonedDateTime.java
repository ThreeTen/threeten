/**
 * A date-time with a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 * such as {@code 2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00 Europe/Paris}.
 * <p>
 * {@code ZonedDateTime} is an immutable representation of a date-time with a time-zone.
 * This class stores all date and time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds,
 * as well as a time-zone and zone offset. For example, the value
 * "2nd October 2007 at 13:45.30.123456789 +02:00 in the Europe/Paris time-zone"
 * can be stored in a {@code ZonedDateTime}.
 * <p>
 * The purpose of storing the time-zone is to distinguish the ambiguous case where
 * the local time-line overlaps, typically as a result of the end of daylight time.
 * Information about the local-time can be obtained using methods on the time-zone.
 * <p>
 * This class provides control over what happens at these cutover points
 * (typically a gap in spring and an overlap in autumn). The {@link ZoneResolver}
 * interface and implementations in {@link ZoneResolvers} provide strategies for
 * handling these cases. The methods {@link #withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap()} and
 * {@link #withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()} provide further control for overlaps.
 * 
 * <h4>Implementation notes</h4>
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
