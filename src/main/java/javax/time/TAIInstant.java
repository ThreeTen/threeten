/**
 * An instantaneous point on the time-line measured in the TAI time-scale.
 * <p>
 * Most of the Time Framework for Java works on the assumption that the time-line is
 * simple, there are no leap-seconds and there are always 24 * 60 * 60 seconds in a day.
 * However, the Earth's rotation is not straightforward, and a solar day does not match
 * this definition.
 * <p>
 * This class is an alternative representation based on the TAI time-scale.
 * TAI is a single incrementing count of SI seconds.
 * There are no leap seconds or other discontinuities.
 * <p>
 * As a result of the simple definition, this time-scale would make an excellent timestamp.
 * However, there are, at the time of writing, few easy ways to obtain an accurate TAI instant,
 * but it is relatively easy to obtain a GPS instant.
 * GPS and TAI differ by the fixed amount of 19 seconds.
 * <p>
 * The duration between two points on the TAI time-scale is calculated solely using this class.
 * Do not use the {@code between} method on {@code Duration} as that will lose information.
 * Instead use {@link #durationUntil(TAIInstant)} on this class.
 * <p>
 * It is intended that most applications will use the {@code Instant} class
 * which uses the UTC-SLS mapping from UTC to guarantee 86400 seconds per day.
 * Specialist applications with access to an accurate time-source may find this class useful.
 * 
 * <h4>Time-scale</h4>
 * <p>
 * The TAI time-scale is a very simple well-regarded representation of time.
 * The scale is defined using atomic clocks counting SI seconds.
 * It has proceeded in a continuous uninterrupted manner since the defined
 * epoch of {@code 1958-01-01T00:00:00(TAI)}.
 * There are no leap seconds or other discontinuities.
 * <p>
 * This class may be used for instants in the far past and far future.
 * Since some instants will be prior to 1958, it is not strictly an implementation of TAI.
 * Instead, it is a proleptic time-scale based on TAI and equivalent to it since 1958.
 * 
 * <h4>Implementation notes</h4>
 * <p>
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
