/**
 * A day-of-week, such as 'Tuesday'.
 * <p>
 * {@code DayOfWeek} is an enum representing the 7 days of the week -
 * Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
 * <p>
 * All date-time fields have an {@code int} value.
 * The {@code int} value follows the ISO-8601 standard, from 1 (Monday) to 7 (Sunday).
 * It is recommended that applications use the enum rather than the {@code int} value
 * to ensure code clarity.
 * <p>
 * This enum provides access to the localized textual form of the day-of-week.
 * Some locales also assign different numeric values to the days, declaring Sunday to have
 * the value 1. This class provides no support for localized numbering.
 * <p>
 * <b>Do not use {@code ordinal()} to obtain the numeric representation of {@code DayOfWeek}.
 * Use {@code getValue()} instead.</b>
 * <p>
 * This enum represents a common concept that is found in many calendar systems.
 * As such, this enum may be used by any calendar system that has the day-of-week
 * concept defined exactly equivalent to the ISO calendar system.
 * 
 * <h4>Implementation notes</h4>
 * This is an immutable and thread-safe enum.
