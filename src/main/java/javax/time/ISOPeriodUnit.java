/**
 * The units of time used by the ISO calendar system, such as 'Days' or 'Minutes'.
 * <p>
 * {@code ISOPeriodUnit} consists of immutable definitions of units of human-scale time.
 * For example, humans typically measure periods of time in units of years, months,
 * days, hours, minutes and seconds. These concepts are defined by instances of
 * this class defined in the chronology classes.
 * <p>
 * Units are either basic or derived. A derived unit can be converted accurately to
 * another smaller unit. A basic unit is fundamental, and has no smaller representation.
 * For example years are a derived unit consisting of 12 months, where a month is a basic unit.
 * <p>
 * Other calendar systems should re-use units from here where appropriate.
 * For example, the definition of a day is usually the same in other calendar systems.
 * To be able to re-use a unit, the definition in the other calendar system must match the
 * definition of a unit and all its dependent units.
 * <p>
 * This class is final, immutable and thread-safe.
