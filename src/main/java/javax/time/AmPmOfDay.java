/**
 * A half-day before or after midday, with the values 'AM' and 'PM'.
 * <p>
 * {@code AmPmOfDay} is an enum representing the half-day concepts of AM and PM.
 * AM is defined as from 00:00 to 11:59, while PM is defined from 12:00 to 23:59.
 * <p>
 * The calendrical framework requires date-time fields to have an {@code int} value.
 * The {@code int} value follows {@link Calendar}, assigning 0 to AM and 1 to PM.
 * It is recommended that applications use the enum rather than the {@code int} value
 * to ensure code clarity.
 * <p>
 * <b>Do not use {@code ordinal()} to obtain the numeric representation of {@code AmPmOfDay}.
 * Use {@code getValue()} instead.</b>
 * <p>
 * This enum represents a common concept that is found in many calendar systems.
 * As such, this enum may be used by any calendar system that has the month-of-year
 * concept defined exactly equivalent to the ISO calendar system.
 * <p>
 * This is an immutable and thread-safe enum.
