/**
 * A unit of time for measuring a period, such as 'Days' or 'Minutes'.
 * <p>
 * {@code PeriodUnit} is an immutable definition of a unit of human-scale time.
 * For example, humans typically measure periods of time in units of years, months,
 * days, hours, minutes and seconds. These concepts are defined by instances of
 * this class defined in the chronology classes.
 * <p>
 * Units are either basic or derived. A derived unit can be converted accurately to
 * another smaller unit. A basic unit is fundamental, and has no smaller representation.
 * For example years are a derived unit consisting of 12 months, where a month is a basic unit.
 * The equivalent period in the base unit can be obtained from this unit.
 * <p>
 * This abstract class must be implemented with care to ensure other classes in
 * the framework operate correctly.
 * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * The subclass is fully responsible for serialization as all fields in this class are
 * transient. The subclass must use {@code readResolve} to replace the deserialized
 * class with a valid one created via a constructor.
