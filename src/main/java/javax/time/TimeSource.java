/**
 * A source providing access to the current instant.
 * <p>
 * The Time Framework for Java abstracts the concept of the "current time" into two interfaces
 * - {@code TimeSource} and {@link javax.time.calendar.Clock Clock}.
 * This class, provides access to the current {@code Instant} which is independent of
 * local factors such as time-zone and cannot be queried for human-scale fields.
 * By comparison, {@code Clock} provides access to the current date and time, via
 * human-scale fields, but requires a time-zone.
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this abstraction is to allow alternate time-sources
 * to be plugged in as and when required. Applications use an object to obtain
 * the current time rather than a static method. This simplifies testing.
 * 
 * <h4>Best practice</h4>
 * The recommended best practice for applications is to <i>avoid using the static methods</i>.
 * Instead, the main application should obtain the current time from a {@code TimeSource}
 * instance that is passed to the object or method.
 * This approach is typically implemented using a dependency injection framework.
 * <pre>
 * public class MyBean {
 *   final TimeSource timeSource;
 *   &#064;Inject MyBean(TimeSource ts) {
 *       this.timeSource = ts;
 *   }
 *   public void process(Instant eventTime) {
 *     if (eventTime.isBefore(timeSource.instant()) {
 *       ...
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * This approach allows alternate time-source implementations, such as
 * {@link #fixed(InstantProvider) fixed} or {@link #offsetSystem(Duration) offsetSystem}
 * to be used during testing.
 * <pre>
 * public void test_process() {
 *   MyBean bean = new MyBean(TimeSource.fixed(Instant.EPOCH)) {
 *   assert ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h4>Accuracy</h4>
 * The main method used by applications is {@link #instant()}.
 * This returns the best value available for the current instant ignoring leap-seconds.
 * To achieve this, the instant may not be fully accurate around a leap-second.
 * <p>
 * Two alternative methods are available and may return a more accurate instant depending
 * on the implementation. The instant in UTC, taking into account leap seconds, can be
 * obtained using {@link #utcInstant()}. The instant in TAI, which is a simple incrementing number
 * ignoring all human time concepts, can be obtained using {@link #taiInstant()}.
 * See the relevant classes for more detail.
 * 
 * <h4>Implementation notes</h4>
 * <p>
 * This is an abstract class and must be implemented with care
 * to ensure other classes in the framework operate correctly.
 * All implementations must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 * Subclasses should be {@code Serializable} wherever possible.
 * They should also implement {@code equals()}, {@code hashCode()} and
 * {@code toString()} based on their state.
