/**
 * A clock providing access to the current date and time.
 * <p>
 * The Time Framework for Java abstracts the concept of the 'current time' into two interfaces
 * - {@link TimeSource} and {@code Clock}.
 * The former, {@code TimeSource}, provides access to the current instant and
 * is independent of local factors such as time-zone.
 * The latter, this class, provides access to the current date and
 * time but requires a time-zone.
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this abstraction is to allow alternate time-sources
 * to be plugged in as and when required. Applications use an object to obtain
 * the current time rather than a static method. This simplifies testing.
 * <p>
 * Applications should <i>avoid</i> using the static methods on this class.
 * Instead, they should pass a {@code Clock} into any method that requires it.
 * A dependency injection framework is one way to achieve this:
 * <pre>
 * public class MyBean {
 *   private Clock clock;  // dependency inject
 *   ...
 *   public void process(LocalDate eventDate) {
 *     if (eventDate.isBefore(clock.today()) {
 *       ...
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * This approach allows alternate time-source implementations, such as
 * {@link TimeSource#fixed} to be used during testing.
 *
 * <h4>Implementation notes</h4>
 * This abstract class must be implemented with care to ensure other classes in
 * the framework operate correctly.
 * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * The class is designed to be subclassed, however this will rarely be necessary.
 * In most cases, you should subclass {@code TimeSource} instead.
 * <p>
 * A subclass will normally override {@code getSource()} and {@code getZone()}.
 * This will cause all the other methods to work as they are derived from just these two.
 * Subclasses should implement {@code withSource()} and {@code withZone()}
 * if possible to allow the user to change the time-source and time-zone.
 * The default implementation of these four methods throws an {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
 * <p>
 * One reason to subclass this class would be to provide only a hard coded date for testing
 * and not a time or date-time. In this case, the subclass would only override {@code today()}.
 * Other methods would thus throw {@code UnsupportedOperationException}, which would be fine
 * for testing but not recommended for production usage.
 * <p>
 * Subclass implementations should implement {@code Serializable} wherever possible.
 * They should also implement {@code equals()}, {@code hashCode()} and
 * {@code toString()} based on their state.
