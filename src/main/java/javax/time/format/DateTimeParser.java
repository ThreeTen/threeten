/**
 * Strategy for parsing text to calendrical information.
 * <p>
 * The parser may parse any piece of text from the input, storing the result
 * in the context. Typically, each individual parser will just parse one
 * field, such as the day-of-month, storing the value in the context.
 * Once the parse is complete, the caller will then convert the context
 * to a {@link CalendricalEngine} to merge the parsed values to create the
 * desired object, such as a {@code LocalDate}.
 * <p>
 * The parse position will be updated during the parse. Parsing will start at
 * the specified index and the return value specifies the new parse position
 * for the next parser. If an error occurs, the returned index will be negative
 * and will have the error position encoded using the complement operator.
 * <p>
 * This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes in
 * the framework operate correctly.
 * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * The context is not a thread-safe object and a new instance will be created
 * for each parse that occurs. The context must not be stored in an instance
 * variable or shared with any other threads.
