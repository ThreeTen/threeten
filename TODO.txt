Simple tasks
------------
- Year.parse(String), Year.parse(String,DateTimeFormatter) and toString(DateTimeFormatter) (based on similar methods in YearMonth/MonthDay)
- LocalDate constants for MIN_DATE/MAX_DATE (using Year.MIN_VALUE Jan 1/MAX_VALUE Dec 31)
- LocalTime constants for MIN_TIME/MAX_TIME (using MIN = MIDNIGHT, and MAX = 23:59:59.999999999)
- LocalDateTime constants for MIN_DATE_TIME/MAX_DATE_TIME (combining min and max from LocalDate/LocalTime)
- Obtain rules from TZDB rather than a file


More complex tasks
------------------
Utils
- MathUtils can't be public, can't put in java.math as we require JDK5 support

Duration

Instant
- toString/parse

Time scales

Date/Time classes
- DateResolver rework - takes int or MonthOfDay or calendricals
- factories taking double for seconds (LocalTime...)
- OffsetDateTime.toEpochSecs() could be private
? ZoneResolver code moved to ZDT
? InstantProvider implementations toEpochMillis()
? getMonthOfYear() -> getMonth(), etc
? with(rule, value)
? Calendrical rule for date/time as a period (for between calculations)

Rules
- test min/max year for week-based-year
- ensure other calendar systems re-use ISO defined rules
- Handle case where values have gaps, eg 1,2, 4,5,6, 8
? parse()
? merge -> normalize
? deriveInt for fields
? ISO era

Date/Time formatting
- merger - general processing
- merger - days overflow
- merge ISO weekyear
- parse 24:00 - maybe a special end-of-day class?
- SPI for date-time text
- strict/lenient parse
? upper/lower case
- only ASCII numbers
- Arabic numbers have negative sign after number
- parseInto(Calendrical)
- default calendrical to pre-define era for example
- check compatible with RFC "Wed, 02 Apr 2008" and j.u.Date "Wed Apr 02 time zone 2008"
? substitute text (replacing built in text for Months/DOW etc)

Time zones
- Use WET/CET/EET as valid short abbreviations?
- Promote TimeDefinition to top-level type
- don't use Local Mean Time (or anything before 1900?)
- SPI for zone names
# some zones have transitions where only the name changes - America/Resolute
# "resolvers need to use correct rules" what does this mean?
- parse/format names
- test against TZDB binary data
? get region ids by offset (JDK method)
? Drop Etc (signs reversed), Older country based IDs
# (EST, MST, HST changed in 2005r - no longer observe DST - http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Intl/alertFurtherInfo.html)
# (MET no longer Asia/Tehran, now Middle Europe)

# Exception on bad zone - http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4412864

Periods
- Between factories
- rename classes?
- Formatting/parsing (defer?)
- Period.toString is not output of state

Matchers/Adjusters
- DateTimeAdjuster
- more general next/previous
? recurrences

Calendars
- HistoricChronology
- EthiopicChronology
- more calendar systems
- Coptic year definition
- plus/minus long vs int

JDK integration
- Proper integration into OpenJDK classes for providers
- Proper CLDR provider implementations

General
- remove ArithmeticException from javadoc -> spec/overview
- rework Clock - remove instant()
- TimeSource get to nearest second etc. with caching?
- cache todays date
- localized day of week number
- get month/weekday text
- get rule by name
- get chrono by name
- serialization formats
- evaluate hash codes
- check overflows
- factories/methods taking double

===============================================================================
Possible items
- Rename DateProvider to LocalDateProvider?
- roll()
- round() - truncateToSeconds() feels weird
- iteration
- era in the hash codes
- ModJulDays rule - BigDecimal
- IntValue interface, implemented by Number/Integer
- public factory for LocalDate.fromDayOfYear(year, doy)
- Optimise LocalDateTime plus/minus times by having a local plus(int,int,int,long,sign,LocalDate) method
- intervals (defer completely?)
- HalfDays period unit for AM/PM (more accurate than 12 hours)
- InvalidDateException - better exception name?
- simplify Clock to Calendrical, merging

Use cases
- Day of Olympiad (roughly four year period)

===============================================================================
Done

Document
- requirement: non JDK extensible
- null approach - nulls rejected except in isXxx() and in framework-level code
- type-safe where sensible
- many-headed problem
-- Zone - Local/Offset/Zoned
-- Precision - Y/YM/YMD/HM/HMS/HMSN/DateTime/...
-- Calendar - ISO/Julian/Coptic/...
-- FieldTypes - Y/M/D/H/M/S...
-- Periods - Y/M/D/H/M/S...
- Joda issues
-- Instant vs Partial
-- Partial with time zone
-- Not easily extensible
-- Chronology is complex
-- Date holding chronology is complex
-- Exposed long millis
- Parsing with wrong pattern letter case (month vs minute, doy vs dom) is caught

Periods
- PeriodFields.of(3.25, Hours) -> [3 Hours, 15 Minutes]

Not doing
- Use nanoOfDay rule in LocalTime factory - NO, as doesn't work
- toString(pattern)/parse(str, pattern) - NO, due to ease of formatter usage
- Add getAmPm() to time classes - NO, due to low use case
- Remove TimeSource replace by InstantProvider - NO, due to UTC/TAI
